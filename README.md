# LMFNet  
Lightweight Multi-Scale Feature Extraction with Fully Connected LMF Layer for Salient Object Detection

## üîç Abstract  
In the domain of computer vision, multi-scale feature extraction is vital for tasks such as salient object detection.  However, achieving this capability in lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between efficiency and performance.  This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure.  By integrating multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for salient object detection.  Our approach significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining competitive performance.  Here, we show that LMFNet achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.  Our work not only addresses the challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks.
